# myDSL | My Data Structure Library
This program was created to practice data structures in C++.
Some of the data structures this header contains:
* Linked List (Double & Single)
* Trees, Tries and Graphs
* Stacks and Queues
* Heaps
* Hash Tables

## Linked List
The Linked List's basics are finish but I plan to add more functions and algorithms to the structure to further my practice with it.
